# Hello!

These are some helpful command shortcuts I made for myself.

Clone the repo, run `setup.bat`, and follow the instructions in
`.env.bat.template` to use them yourself.

## Commands

The `commands` folder contains batch scripts I find useful.
Running `setup.bat` will add the `commands` folder to the PATH environment variable, so the scripts can be referenced anywhere.
